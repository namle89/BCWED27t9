1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
All right well this is a 650 Tech talk thank you all so much for coming so about a week ago we circulated the Google form

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
How warm is you might have seen at 10:52 a.m. and by like 11:52 a.m. we had a hundred is which I think is

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:18,944
Play sort of Testament to just how much interest there is in this world of AI and open Ai and GPT Chachi PT in the like

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
And in fact if you're sort of generally familiar with what everyone's talking about but you haven't tried it yourself like this is the URL

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,672
What you can try out this tool that you've probably heard about chat GPT

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
You can sign up for a free account there and start tinkering with what everyone else has been tinkering with and then if you're more of the app mind

7
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:41,472
Has its own low-level apis

8
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
Actions and services that have been built on top of these Technologies and we're so happy today to be joined by our friends from McGill

9
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
Spell university and steamship

10
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Are seal and Ted from you here in just a moment to speak to us about how they are making it easier to build

11
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
To deploy to share applications using some of these very same technology so are things to them for hosting today our friends

12
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
Did Clemson Jenny Lee an alumna who's here with us today but without further Ado allow me to turn things over to Ted and sill and pizza will be served shortly

13
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Play after 1:00 p.m. outside

14
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
Thanks a lot

15
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Hey everybody it's great to be here I think we've got a really good talk for you today still going to provide some res

16
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,368
Research grounding into how it all works what's going inside

17
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,952
The brain of GPT as well as other language models

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,096
And then I'll show you some examples that we're seeing on the ground of how people are building apps and what apps tend to work in the real world

19
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
So our perspective is we're building AWS for AI app so we get to talk to a lot of the makers who are building and deploying their apps

20
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
And through that see both the experimental end of the spectrum

21
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,944
And also see what kinds of apps are getting pushed out there and turned into companies turned into side projects

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
We did a cool

23
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
A hackathon yesterday many things to Neiman to David Manning cs50 for helping us put all of

24
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Put this together to Harvard for hosting it

25
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,768
And there were two sessions lots of folks built things if you go to

26
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
Steamship dot calm slash hackathon you'll find a lot of guides a lot of projects that people build and you can follow along we have a

27
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
Text guide as well just as a quick plug for that

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,800
If you want to do it remotely or on your own

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,688
To tee up so we're going to talk about basically two things today that I hope you walk away with

30
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
What is GPT and how is it working

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:38,208
You can get a good sense of what's going on inside of it other than as just this magical machine that predicts things

32
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
And then two is how are people building with it and then importantly how can I

33
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
Build with it too if you are Developer and if you have cs50 background you should be able to pick things up and start building some great apps I've

34
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
I've already met some of the cs50 grads yesterday

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
And the things that they were doing were pretty amazing so

36
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
And talk about some of the theoretical background of GPT

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,016
Yeah so thank you Ted my name is song

38
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
Graduate student in the digital Humanities at Miguel

39
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,904
I studied literature and computer science in linguistics in the same breath

40
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
And I published some research over the last couple of years exploring what is possible

41
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
With language models

42
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
And culture in particular

43
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
My

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,472
Whatever of the presentation is to describe to you what is GPT

45
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
That's really difficult to explain in 15 minutes

46
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,664
And there are even a lot of things that we don't know but a good way to approach that is the first consider all the things

47
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
The people call GPT by

48
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
Play or descript

49
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
So you can call them large language models

50
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
You can call them Universal

51
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,696
From computer science you can say that that it is a generative AI

52
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,048
We know that they are neural networks we know that it is an artificial intelligence

53
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,632
The sun is a simulator of culture to others it just predicts text

54
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,776
You can plug in a pit of your essay get some feedback it's amazing for that

55
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,384
It's a Content generator people use it to do copywriting Jasper dot AI

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Should I write etcetera

57
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
It's an agent so the really hot thing right now if you want to see it on Twitter Auto GPT baby AGI

58
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
People are giving these things tools

59
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
And letting them run a little bit free in the wild

60
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
Turn tracks with the world computers etc

61
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
The actual architecture

62
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,935
Is the Transformers so there's lots of ways to describe GPT

63
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,519
And any other one of them is a really perfectly adequate way

64
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
To begin the conversation

65
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,431
But for our purposes we can think of it as a large language model and more specifically a language model

66
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Is a model of language

67
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,159
If you want me to tautology but really what it does is it produces a probability distribution over some vocabulary

68
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
So what is imagine that we had the task of

69
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Predicting the next word

70
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
On the sequence I am so if I give

71
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
The words I am

72
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
What

73
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
All words in English

74
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
Is the next most likely word to follow

75
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
That at its very core is what GPT

76
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Is trained to answer

77
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,223
And how it does it is it has a vocabulary of 50,000 words

78
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
And it knows roughly given the entire internet

79
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
Which words are likely to follow other words

80
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Are those 50,000 in some sequence up to 2000 words up to 4000 up to 8,000 and now up

81
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
What's 32000354

82
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
So you give it a sequence here I am

83
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,703
And over the vocabulary of 50 words

84
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,311
It gives you the likelihood of every single word that follows so here it's

85
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
I am

86
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Perhaps the word happiest

87
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
Fairly frequent so we'll get that high probability if we look at all words

88
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
All utterances of English

89
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
It might be I am sad maybe that's a little bit

90
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,415
What's probable I am school that really should be at the end cuz I don't think anybody would ever say that

91
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
I am Bjork that's a little bit

92
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
It's not very probable but it's less probable than happy sad but there's still some probability attached to it and when we say it's probable

93
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
Follows I am maybe like 5% of the time

94
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
Side Falls I am maybe 2% of the time

95
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
Or whatever so for every word

96
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
It tries to predict what the next word is

97
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,111
I cross 50,000 words and it gives every single one of those 50,000 words

98
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Number that reflects how probable

99
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,071
And the Really magical thing that happens is you can generate new text

100
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
So if you give GPT I am and it products

101
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,263
Happy as being the most probable word over 50,000

102
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
You can then

103
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
Pendant to I am so now you say I am happy

104
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
And you feed it into the model again

105
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
Can you sample another word you feed it into the model again and again and again and again

106
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
There's lots of different ways that I am happy I am sad can go

107
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,207
And all the sudden you have a language model that can write essays that can talk

108
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
And a whole lot of things

109
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,095
Which is really unexpected and something that we didn't predict more even 5 years ago

110
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
So this is all relevant

111
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
And if we move on

112
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
As we scale up the model and we give it more compute in 2012 Alex that came out and we figured out we can give

113
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
We can run the model on gpus

114
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
So we can speed up the process

115
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,063
We can give the model lots of information downloaded from the internet

116
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
And it learns more and more and

117
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,159
And the probabilities that gives you

118
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
Get better as it sees more examples of English on the

119
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
So we have to train the model to be really large

120
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Really wide

121
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
And with the trainer for a really long time

122
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
And as we do that the model gets more and more

123
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
And it also gets a little bit intelligent

124
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
And for reasons we don't understand

125
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,943
But they also the issue is that because it learns to replicate the internet

126
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
Knows how to speak in a lot of different genres

127
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
What is a text and a lot of different registers

128
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
If you begin the conversation like

129
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,463
Can you explain the moon landing to a 6 year old and a few sentences gpt-3

130
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
Is an example drawn from the instructor GPT paper from openai

131
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Gpt-3 what I'm just been like

132
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Okay so

133
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
You give me an example of explain the moon landing to a 6 year old I'm going to give you a whole bunch of similar things because those seem very likely to come

134
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,407
It doesn't necessarily understand that it's being asked a question has to respond with an

135
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
Gpt-3 did

136
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,039
Don't have the apparatus that interface for responding

137
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
The scientist

138
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
Open it I came up with the solution and that's

139
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,767
Let's give it a whole bunch of examples of question and answers

140
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
Such that we first trained on the internet

141
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,143
And then we train it with a whole bunch of questions and answers

142
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
Such that it has the knowledge of the internet

143
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
But really knows that it has to be answering questions

144
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:50,175
And that is when Chachi PT was born and that's when it gained 100 million users in one

145
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
Record at 20 million in one month

146
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
And for a lot of people

147
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,231
This thing is intelligent I can answer I can ask it questions and answers back we can work together to come to a solution

148
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
And that's because

149
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Put a nose that predicts words

150
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
In the framework

151
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
I have a question and answer

152
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
So that's what a prompt is

153
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
That's what instruction tuning is that's a keyword

154
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,199
Are lhf is if you've ever seen that acronym reinforcement alignment

155
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Human feedback

156
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
And all those combined means that

157
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
The bottles that are coming out today

158
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
The types of language protectors that are coming out today

159
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Work to operate in a Q&A form

160
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,279
GPT 4 exclusively only has the a wine bottle

161
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
Available and this is a really

162
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
Solid foundation to build on

163
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
Because you can do all sorts of things you can ask

164
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
Can you do this for me can you do that for me

165
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,383
You might have seen that openai has allowed plug-in access to check CPT so I can access Wolfram

166
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
I can search the web I can search

167
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
I can do instacart for you

168
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
I can look up recipes

169
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
What's the model

170
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,391
Knows that not only it has to predict language but that it has

171
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Solve the problem

172
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
And the problem here being

173
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
Give me a good answer to my question

174
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,607
It's suddenly able to interface with the world in a really solid way

175
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,703
And from there on there's been all sorts of tools that I build on

176
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
Does Q&A form that Chachi Beattie uses

177
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
You have

178
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
Auto GPT you have Lang chain you have

179
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,479
React there's a react paper where a lot of these come from and

180
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,575
Turn in the model into an agent with which to achieve

181
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,647
Any ambiguous goal is where the future is going

182
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
Good morning and this is all thanks to instruction tuning

183
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
What's that I think I will hand it off to Ted

184
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Who will be giving a demo

185
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
Or something along those lines for how to

186
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Use GPT as

187
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
All right so I'm a super applied guy

188
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
I kind of look at things and think okay how can I like to add this Lego add that Lego and clip them together

189
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Together and build something with it

190
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,367
And right now you know if you look back in computer science history

191
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,951
When you look at the kinds of things that were being done in 1970

192
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,279
Right after Computing was invented the microprocessors were invented

193
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,935
People were doing research like how do I sort a list of numbers and that was meaningful work and importantly it was work that successful

194
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:26,335
Call to everybody because nobody knows what we can build with this new kind of oil this new kind of electricity this new kind of unit

195
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Do you need a computation

196
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,759
We've created and anything was game and anybody could participate in that game to figure it out and I think one of the really

197
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
Play exciting things about GPT right now

198
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
Is yes in and of itself it's amazing

199
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
But then what could we do with it

200
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
If we call it over and over again if we build it into our algorithms and start to build it into broader software so the world really is

201
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
Yours to figure out this fundamental questions about what could you do if you could script computation itself over

202
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Over and over again

203
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,103
In the way that computers can do not just talk with it but build things a topic

204
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,503
So we're hosting company we host apps and these are just some of the things that we see I'm going to show you demos of this

205
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
What is with code and try to explain some of the thought process but I wanted to give you a high level of overview of you've probably seen these on

206
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303
Open Twitter but kind of win it all sorts out to the top these are some of the things that we're seeing built and deployed with language

207
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
What's the models today

208
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Companionship

209
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
That's everything for my need a friend do I need a friend with a purpose I want to coach I want somebody to tell me go to the gym and do these

210
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
What size is I want somebody to help me study a foreign language

211
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
Question answering this is a big one this is everything from your Newsroom having a slack bot that helps assist you does

212
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
What is this article

213
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
Conform to the Style Guidelines of our Newsroom all the way through to I need help on my homework or hey I have

214
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
Play some questions that I want you to ask Wikipedia

215
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
Combine it with something else synthesized the answer and give it to me

216
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,655
Utility functions I would describe this as there's a large set of things for which

217
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
Human beings can do them if only or computers could do them if only they had access to language computation

218
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
An example of this would be

219
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,175
Read every tweet on Twitter tell me the ones I should read

220
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,271
That way I only get to read the ones that actually makes sense to me and I don't have to skim through the rest

221
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Creativity

222
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,647
Image generation text generation storytelling proposing other ways to do things

223
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
And then these wild experiments and kind of baby AGI

224
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:26,911
In which the AI itself decides what to do in a self-directed so I'll show you examples of many of these and what the code looks like

225
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,263
And if I were you I would think about these as categories within which

226
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
To both think about what you might build

227
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
And then also seek out

228
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
Start a projects for how you might go about building them

229
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Online

230
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,159
All right so I'm just going to dive straight into demos and code for some of these cuz I know that's what's interesting to see as fellow builders

231
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,231
With the high level diagram for some of these is to how it works

232
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:56,863
So approximately you can think of a companionship bot as a friend that has a purpose to you

233
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
And there are many ways to build all of these things but one of the ways you can build this is simply to wrap GPT

234
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
What language model

235
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
In an endpoint that additionally injection to the prompt

236
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,711
Some particular perspective or some particular goal that you want to use

237
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,319
It really is that easy in a way but it's also very hard because you need to iterate

238
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Engineer the prompt

239
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,159
Consistently performs the way

240
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
You want it to perform

241
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
So a good example of this is something somebody built into hackathon yesterday and I just wanted to show you the project that they built it was

242
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
It was a mandarin idiom coach

243
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,703
And I'll show you what the code look like first I'll show you the Demo First

244
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
I think I already pulled it up

245
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Here we go

246
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
So

247
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,223
The buddy that this person wanted to create was a friend that if you

248
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,807
Gave it a particular problem you were having

249
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,135
It would pick a Chinese idiom a four character chunk

250
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,535
That describe poetically like here's a particular way you could say this and it would tell it to her so that the

251
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
The person who built this was studying Chinese and she wanted to learn more about it so I might say something like I'm feeling

252
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Very sad

253
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
If everything's up and running

254
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
It will

255
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Generate one of these four character phrases

256
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
And it will respond to it

257
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:24,159
With an example now I don't know if this is correct or not so if somebody can call me out if this is actually incorrect you please please please

258
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Call me

259
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
And it will then finish up with something encouraging say Hey you can do it I know this is hard keep going so let me show you how they built this

260
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Yes and I

261
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Pulled up

262
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
The code

263
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Right here

264
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
So this was the

265
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,639
Particular starter replit

266
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
In the hackathon yesterday

267
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,063
You have a wrapper around GPT

268
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,927
And there's many things you could do but we're going to make it easy for you to do two things one of them

269
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
Is to inject some personality into the prom

270
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,399
And then the second is ADD tools that might go out and do a particular thing search the web

271
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:11,263
Or generate an image or add something to a database or fetch something from a database

272
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
So having done that

273
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,687
Now you have something more than GPT now you have GPT which we all know what it is and how we can interact with it

274
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
Added a particular lens through which it's talking to you and potentially some tools so this particular

275
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Chinese tutor

276
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,183
All it took to build that was

277
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Lines

278
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
So here's the question that I think is

279
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
Is frying the minds of everybody in the industry right now

280
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
So is this something that will all do casually and nobody really knows will we just all say in the future to the llm hey for the next

281
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Next 5 minutes please talk like a teacher and maybe

282
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,407
But also definitely in the meantime and maybe in the future it makes sense to wrap up

283
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,807
I'm not just talking to GPT I have a whole Army of different buddies of different

284
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,415
Companions that I can talk to they're kind of human and kind of talk to me interactively

285
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,767
But because I preloaded them with hey by the way you particular

286
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,887
I want you to be kind helpful Chinese teacher that responds to every situation by explaining the chunk of its it

287
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
Speak in English and explain the children in its meaning

288
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,519
Then provide a note of encouragement about learning language

289
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
It's just adding something like that

290
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Even if you're not programmer

291
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
You can just type deploy

292
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
And it'll pop it up to the web

293
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,111
It'll take it over to a telegram bot then you can even interact with hey

294
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
I'm feeling too busy

295
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,303
And interact with it over telegram over the web and this is the kind of thing that's now Within Reach

296
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,679
For everybody from cs101 grad sorry I'm using the general purpose framing

297
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
All the way through to Professionals in the industry that you can do just with a little bit of manipulation on top of

298
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
Conversation and intelligence

299
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
So companionship

300
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Is is one of the first Common

301
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
Types of apps that we're seeing

302
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,303
Kind of app that we're seeing and this blew up if for those of you who are on

303
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Kind of Twitter followers

304
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
This blew up

305
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
I think the last few months

306
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,263
Is question answering I want to unpack a couple of different ways this can work

307
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
Because I know many of you have probably already

308
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
I tried to build

309
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
Some of these kinds of apps there's a couple of different ways that it works

310
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
The general framework is

311
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:32,575
A user queries GPT and maybe it has general purpose knowledge maybe it doesn't have general purpose knowledge

312
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
But what you wanted to say

313
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Play back to you

314
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
Is something specific about an article you wrote

315
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
Or something specific about

316
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,399
A particular set of documents from the United Nations on a particular topic

317
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:52,287
We've all interacted with these customer service spots

318
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,359
What kind of Smashing our heads on the keyboard as we do it

319
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:01,247
Pretty soon we're going to start to see very high fidelity Bots that interact with this comfortably

320
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,599
And this is approximately how to do it as an engineer so here's your game plan as an engineer

321
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
Step one

322
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Take the documents

323
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
Do you want it to respond to

324
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Step two

325
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Cut them up now

326
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
For example

327
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,239
You could cut them up into clean sentences or clean paragraphs

328
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
Or semantically coherent

329
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,455
Honestly the way that most folks do it and this is a simplification that turns out tends to be just fine

330
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,551
Is you window you have a sliding window that goes over the document

331
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
And you just pull out fragments of text

332
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:43,999
Having pulled out those fragments of text you turn them into something called an embedding Vector it's an embedding vector

333
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Is a list of numbers

334
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
That approximate some point of meaning

335
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,263
So you've already all dealt with embedding vectors yourself and regular life and the reason you have and I know you have is because everybody's order

336
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Ordered food from Yelp before

337
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
You look at

338
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:04,991
What genre of restaurant is it is it in a pizza restaurant is it an Italian restaurant is it a Korean barbecue place

339
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
How many stars does it have one two three four five

340
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,975
You look at where is it so all of these you can think of as points in space dimensions in space Korean barbecue

341
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Four stars

342
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Near my house

343
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
It's a

344
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Three number vect

345
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
That's all this

346
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,495
So this is a thousand number of vector or 10,000 number Vector different models produce different sized vectors

347
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
All it is

348
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Is chunking pieces of text

349
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,223
Turning it into a vector that approximates meaning and then you put it in something called the vector database and a vector database is just a database

350
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Pet stores numbers

351
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
But having that database

352
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
Now when I ask a question

353
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,463
I can search the database and I can say hey the question was what does cs50 teach

354
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
What pieces of text

355
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
In the database

356
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
Have vectors similar

357
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
To the question

358
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
What does cs50 teach

359
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:01,055
And there's all sorts of tricks and Empires being made on refinements of this General approach

360
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
But at the end you the developer

361
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
Model it simply as thus

362
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
And then when you have your query you embed it

363
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,623
You find the document fragments and then you put them into a prompt and now we're just back to the personality of the

364
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Companionship

365
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Now it's just a prompt

366
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,256
You're an expert in answering questions

367
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Please answer

368
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
User provided question

369
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Using Source documents

370
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Results from the database

371
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
That's it

372
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,824
So after all of these Decades of engineering to these customer service spots it turns out with a couple of lines of code you can build

373
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,712
With the cs50 syllabus so we can

374
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Pull that up

375
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,624
I added the PDF right here

376
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
Search the web for cs50 syllabus

377
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
What does PDF I put the URL in here

378
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,680
Piece of code deployed

379
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:05,312
That will now let me talk to it and I can say what will cs50 teach me

380
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:12,736
What's happening is exactly what that slide just showed you it takes that question what will cs50 teach me

381
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
It turns it into a vector

382
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
That Vector approximates without exactly representing

383
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
The meaning of that question

384
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
It looks into a vector database

385
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Did steamship host

386
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Fragments from that PDF

387
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,168
And then it pulls out a document and then passes it to a prompt that says

388
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,984
You're an expert at answering questions

389
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
Someone has asked you what does cs50 teach

390
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
Please answer it using only the source documents and Source materials I've provided now those Source materials Mater

391
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:48,832
Materials are dynamically loaded into the problem it's just basic prompt engineering and I want to keep harping back on to that

392
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
What's amazing about right now is builders

393
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,744
Is that so many things just boil down to very creative

394
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Tactical

395
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
Rearrangement of prompts

396
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
And then using those over and over again in an algorithm and putting that into software so the result and again it could be lying it could be

397
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
Will you be making things up it could be hallucinating

398
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:12,896
Is cs50 will teach students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently focusing on topics such as abstraction dot dot dot

399
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,200
And then it Returns the source document

400
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
So this is another big category

401
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
Of which there are tons

402
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
Potential applications

403
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,768
You can create arbitrarily many of these once its software because once its software

404
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
You can just repeat it

405
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
Over and over again so for your dorm for your Club

406
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
For your

407
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
For your Telegram

408
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,496
You can start to begin putting pieces of information

409
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:43,360
In and then responding to it and it doesn't have to be documents you can also load it straight

410
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Into the prompt

411
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
I think I have it pulled up here

412
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
And if I don't I'll just skip it

413
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,368
One other way you can do question answering

414
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,488
I think it's healthy to always encourage the simplest possible approach to something

415
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
You don't need to engineer this giant system it's great to have a database it's great to use embeddings it's great to use this big approach it's

416
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
Play Fancy at Scales you can do a lot of things

417
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,776
But you can also get away with a lot

418
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
By just pushing it all into a prompt

419
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,968
Aspire to be lazy and I couldn't agree more

420
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,600
You as an engineer should want to set yourself up so that you can pursue the lazy path

421
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Do something

422
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
So here's how you might do

423
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,536
The equivalent of a question answering system with a prompt alone let's say you have

424
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
30 friends

425
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,888
In each friend is good at a particular thing or you can you know

426
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
Is isomorphic too many other problems

427
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,752
You can simply just say hey I know certain things

428
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Are users going to ask me something

429
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
How should we respond

430
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
And then you load that into an agent

431
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,480
That agent has access to GPT

432
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
You can ship deploy it

433
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,624
And now you've got a bot that you can connect to telegram you can connect to Slack

434
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
And that part

435
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:05,792
The variance of the model underneath

436
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:12,704
It will tend to answer with respect to this list and and the degree to which it tends to is to a certain extent

437
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
Something that both Industries working on to

438
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
Give everybody as a capacity

439
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
But also you doing prompt engineering to tighten up

440
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
The air bars

441
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Just a few more examples

442
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:34,720
And then in about 8 minutes I'll turn it over to questions cuz I'm sure you got a lot about how to build things so just to give you

443
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
A sense of where we are

444
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
This is when I don't have a demo for you

445
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
But if you were to come to me and you were to say Ted

446
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
I want a weekend Hustle Man

447
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
What should I build

448
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
Holy Mol

449
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,968
There are a set of applications that I would describe as utility functions I don't like that name

450
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
Because it doesn't sound exciting and this is really exciting

451
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
Fruits that automate tasks

452
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
The required basic language understanding so examples for this are

453
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Generate a unit test

454
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
I don't know how many of you

455
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,840
Have you ever been writing tests and you're just like oh come on

456
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
I can get through this

457
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
You're lucky individual

458
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
Looking up the documentation for a function rewriting a function making something conform to your company guidelines doing a brand check

459
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
All of these things are things that

460
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Are kind of

461
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
Relatively context-free operations or scoped context operations on a piece of information

462
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
Information that requires linguistic understanding

463
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,328
Really you can think of them as something that is now available to you as a software Builder as a weekend project

464
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
Builder as a startup Builder

465
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,448
And you just have to build the interface around it

466
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,312
Presented to other people in a context in which its meaningful them for them to consume

467
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
And so the space of this

468
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,944
Is extraordinary I mean is the space of all human endeavor

469
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,296
Now with this new tool I think is the way to way to think about it people often joke about how

470
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,136
You don't want to start with a hammer

471
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Because you want you want to start with the problem instead

472
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
And it's generally true but my God

473
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,536
We just got a really cool new hammer

474
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:18,912
And to a certain extent I would encourage you to at least casually on the weekends run around and hit stuff with it and see

475
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,496
What can happen from a builder's from a Tinkers from an experimental

476
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Point of view

477
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
Creativity this is another huge mega app

478
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:37,600
No I'm primarily living the text world and so I'm going to talk about text-based things

479
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:44,000
I think so far this is mostly been growing in the imagery world because we're such visual creatures

480
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
Please and the images you can generate or just staggering

481
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,936
I certainly brings up a lot of questions to around IP and artistic style

482
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,616
Is approximately the following and the thing I want to

483
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:05,504
This is really the purpose of this slide is to touch on the importance of the domain knowledge

484
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
So many people

485
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,416
Approximately find the creative process as follow

486
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
Come up with a big idea

487
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
Over generate possibilities

488
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
Edit it down

489
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
What you over generated

490
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Repeat

491
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
Right like anybody who's been a writer

492
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
And then you have to delete lots of it

493
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,224
This particular task is fantastic for AI one of the reasons it's fantastic for AI

494
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
Is because it allows the eye to be wrong you know you've pre-agreed you're going to delete lots of it and so if you pre agree hey I'm just going to

495
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,256
Generate five possibilities of the story I might tell five possibilities of the advertising headline

496
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,352
Five possibilities of what am I what I might write my thesis on

497
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,680
You are going to be the editor

498
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
Did stepson

499
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,848
And here's the thing that you really should bring to the table is don't think about this as a technical activity think about this

500
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
Is your opportunity not to put GPT in charge

501
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
Instead for you to grasp the steering wheel tighter

502
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
I think at least

503
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,112
In python or the language you're using to program

504
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
Because you have the domain knowledge

505
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,768
To wheel GPT in the generation of those so let me show you an example of what I mean by that

506
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
This is a

507
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
A cool app

508
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,960
Someone created for the writing Atlas project is a set

509
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Short stories

510
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,848
And you can think of it as Goodreads for short stories

511
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
So you can go in here you can browse different stories

512
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,272
You can type in a story description that you like

513
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,112
And this is going to take about a minute to generate so I'm going to talk while it's generating

514
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:58,144
Is it searching through the collection of stories for similar stories and here's where the domain knowledge part comes in

515
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Then it uses GPT

516
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
To look at what it was that you wanted

517
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
And use knowledge of how an editor how a Bookseller thinks to generate a set of suggestions specific

518
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Specifically through the lens

519
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:16,320
Of that perspective with the goal of writing that beautiful handwritten note that we sometimes see in a local bookstore

520
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
Back on underneath

521
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,976
And so it doesn't just say hey you might like this here's a general purpose

522
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,792
Reason why you might like this but specifically

523
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Here's why

524
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
You might like this with respect to what you gave it

525
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
It's either stalling out

526
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,216
Or it's taking a long time oh there we go

527
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
So here's a suggestions

528
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:42,176
In particular these things these are things that only a human could know at least for now

529
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
Two humans specifically

530
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,576
The human who said they wanted to read a story that's the text that came in

531
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,136
And then the human who added domain knowledge

532
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,232
Descriptive sequence of interactions with the language model

533
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,304
So that you could provide very targeted reasoning

534
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,120
Over something that was informed by that domain knowledge

535
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,656
Utility

536
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
Apps bring your bring your domain knowledge

537
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,456
Looks and code cuz I think it's it's it's useful to see how simple and accessible this is

538
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
This is really

539
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
Like a particular location

540
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
Well here's the prompt that did that is an open source project

541
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
Interested in

542
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:36,960
Here's the audience here's a couple of examples of why might people like a particular thing in terms of audience it's just another prompt

543
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,944
And if you go down here and look at how it was done

544
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
Suggesting the story is what is this line 174 to line 203 it really is and and again

545
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
It's really just

546
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
What 20 outlines of Step 1

547
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,144
Search in the database for similar stories

548
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Step two

549
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
Given that I have similar stories pull out the data

550
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
Step 3

551
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
With my domain knowledge in Python

552
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
Now run these prompts

553
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,736
Step four prepare that into an output so the thing we're scripting itself

554
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
Is some approximation of

555
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Is human cognition

556
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:30,720
If you're willing to go there metaphorically we're not you know we're not sure I'm not going to weigh in on where we are on the is openai

557
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
A life form

558
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Argument

559
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,960
All right one kind of really far out there thing and then I'll

560
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,800
Tied up for questions cuz I know there's probably a lot and I also want to make sure you get

561
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Great pizza in your bellies

562
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
And that is a baby AGI

563
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
Auto GPT is what you might have heard them called on Twitter I think of them as multi-step planning bots so everything I showed

564
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Why are you so far

565
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,952
Was approximately one shot interactions with GPT

566
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
So this is the user says they want something

567
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,608
And then either python mediates interactions with GPT

568
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
GPT itself

569
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,520
Does some things with the inflection of a personality that you've added from some prompt engineering

570
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Really useful

571
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,968
Pretty easy to control if you want to go to production if you want to build a weekend project if you want to build a company that's a great way to do it

572
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Right now

573
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,904
This is wild and if you haven't seen this stuff on Twitter I would definitely recommend going to search for it

574
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
This is what happens

575
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,536
If you put GPT in a for Loop

576
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,120
If you let GPT talk to itself and then tell itself what to do

577
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
It's an emergent Behavior

578
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,592
It starts with a few simple steps the Conway's Game of Life

579
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,224
Elements of reality turn out to be math equations that fit on a t-shirt

580
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
This is approximately

581
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
Step one take a human objective

582
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Step two

583
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Your first task

584
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,096
Is to write yourself a list of steps and here's the critical part

585
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Repeat

586
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:20,288
Now do the list of steps now you have to embody your agent with the ability to do things so it's really

587
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,848
You're the only limited to do what you give it the tools to do

588
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
And what has the skills to do

589
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,944
So obviously this is still very much

590
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,344
A set of experiments that are running right now and and but it's something that will see unfold over the coming years and this is the scenario in which

591
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,952
Play python stops becoming so important because we've given it the ability to actually self-direct

592
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
What it's doing

593
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
And then it finally gives you

594
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,656
Engineering which is wild

595
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,960
How little code this is let me show you what

596
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
Baby AGI looks like

597
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
So here is

598
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
Baby AGI that you can connect to Telegram

599
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:07,392
And this is an agent that has two tools so I haven't explained to you what an agent is I haven't explained to you what tools are I'll give you

600
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,440
Give me a quick one sentence description in agent

601
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
Is just a word to mean

602
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
GPT

603
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:18,400
Plus some bigger body in which it's living maybe that body has a personality maybe has tools maybe it has python mediating

604
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Kids experience with other

605
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
Tools are simply

606
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,080
Ways in which the agent can choose to do things like imagine if GPT could say order a pizza

607
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,688
And instead of you seeing the text order a pizza that caused the pizza to be ordered that's a tool

608
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:36,320
To-do list one tool is

609
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Do a search on the web

610
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
And then down here

611
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,632
It has a prompt saying hey your goal is to build a task list and then do that task list

612
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,192
And then this is just placed into a harness

613
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,752
It does it over and over again so after the next task

614
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,056
Turn on cue the results of that task

615
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
And keep it going

616
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
You get this kickstarted Loop

617
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
We're essentially you Kickstart it

618
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
And then the agent is talking to itself

619
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
Stop talking to yourself

620
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:13,440
So this unless I'm wrong I don't think this is yet reached production in terms of what we're seeing in the field of how people are deploying

621
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Keep playing software

622
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,840
But if you want to dive into sort of the wildest part of experimentation this is definitely one of the places you can start

623
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
All you have to do

624
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
Is download one of the starter projects for it

625
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,056
And you can kind of see right in the prompting here's how you kick start that process

626
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Obliteration

627
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
All right so I know that was super high level

628
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
I hope it was useful

629
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,744
I think from the field from the bottoms up what we're seeing and what people are building and the high level categories

630
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,792
Of apps that people are making

631
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:54,144
All of these apps are apps that are within reach to everybody which is really really exciting

632
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,008
And there's a I suggest Twitter is a great place to hang out and build things

633
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,336
There's a lot of AI builders on Twitter publishing

634
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:07,200
And if I think we got a couple minutes before Pizza is arriving maybe 10 minutes keep on going

635
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
Kick it to that cuz I'm sure there's some

636
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,624
Questions that you all have I guess I need a little early

637
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,072
The question was how is approximately how do you manage the hallucination problem if you give it a physics

638
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,376
Lecture and you ask it a question

639
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,448
On the one hand it appears to be answering you correctly

640
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,288
On the other hand it appears to be wrong to an expert's i

641
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
40% of the time 70 of the time 10 of the time

642
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
It's a huge problem

643
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:12,480
And then what are some ways is developers practically you can use to mitigate that

644
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,576
I'll get an answer so you may have some specific things too so one high level answer is

645
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
The same thing that makes these things capable of synthesizing information is part of the reason why it hallucinates for you so it's hard to have

646
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
Have your cake and eat it too to a certain extent

647
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,840
So this is part of the game in fact humans do it too

648
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:34,240
Make people talk about you know just folks who kind of are too aggressive in their assumptions about knowledge I can't remember the name for

649
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,384
Some things you can do

650
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:46,784
Are kind of a range of activities depending on how much money you're willing to spend how much technical expertise you have that can range from fine-tuning a model

651
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
To practically I'm in the applied world so I'm very much in the world of duct tape and sort of how developers get stuff done so

652
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Giving an example

653
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,352
Tends to work for a cute things if it's behaving in wild ways

654
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Is the more examples you give it

655
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,728
That's not going to solve the domain of all of physics

656
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:12,128
So for the domain of all the physics I'm going to I'm going to bail and give it to you cuz I think you are far more equipped than me to speak on that sure so

657
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
The bottle doesn't have

658
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
A ground TR

659
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,528
It doesn't know anything any sense of meeting that is derived from the training process

660
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
Is purely out of

661
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,416
Differentiation one word is not another word words are not used

662
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
The same contact

663
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:31,072
It understands everything only through examples given through language it's like someone who learned English

664
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
Or how to speak

665
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
But they grew up in a featureless gray room that never seen the outside world they have nothing to rest on that tells them that something is

666
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
True and something is not true

667
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
So from the models perspective everything that it says

668
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:47,200
It's true it's trying its best to give you the best answer possible and if

669
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,832
Lying a little bit or conflating two different topics is the best way to achieve that then it will decide to do so

670
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,904
It's a part of the architecture we can't get around it

671
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,208
There are a number of cheap tricks

672
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
That surprisingly get it to confabulate her hallucinate less one of them includes recently there was a paper that's a little funny

673
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,656
If you get it to pretend

674
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
My best guess is

675
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,008
That will actually improve

676
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,080
Or reduce hallucinations by about 80%

677
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,944
But we're not quite sure what that is

678
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,528
Turn on to what time was saying a few cheap things you can do include

679
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,904
Google or Bing as in bing chai what they're doing and it says this information

680
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,792
Make sure its own responses good if you've ever had such a BT generate a program

681
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
I think there's a mistake

682
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,448
Austin it will locate the mistake itself

683
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,544
Why I didn't produce the right answer at the very beginning we're still not sure

684
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,616
But we're moving in the direction of reducing hallucinations not with respect

685
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Physics

686
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
You're going to have to give it an external database

687
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,992
To restaurant because internally

688
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
For really really

689
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,112
Domain specific knowledge it's not going to

690
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
B

691
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,768
Deterministic as one would like these things work and continuous spaces these things

692
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
They don't know what is wrong what is true

693
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
And as a result

694
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,568
Striving at reducing hallucinations actually really and giving it more AB

695
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,968
One of the ways to that I mean I'm a simple guy like I tend to think that

696
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,808
All of the world tends to be just a few things repeated over and over again

697
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
Keep playing sports

698
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,744
And we're not right all the time even when we aspire to be

699
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,584
And so we have systems that we've developed as humans to deal with

700
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
Things that may be wrong

701
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,680
So you know human number one proposes an answer

702
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,472
Human number two checks their work

703
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,616
Human number three provides the final sign-off this is really common anybody who's worked in a company has seen this in practice

704
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,943
The interesting thing about the state of software right now

705
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
We tend to be in this mode in which we're just talking to GPT is one entity

706
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,367
But once we start thinking in terms of teams

707
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Is so to speak

708
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,231
Where each team member is its own agent with its own set of objectives and skills

709
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:13,887
I suspect we're going to start seeing a programming model in which the way to solve this might not necessarily be

710
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,423
Make a single brain smarter

711
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,543
But instead be draw upon the collective intelligence of multiple software agents

712
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Each playing a row

713
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
And and I think that that

714
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,919
Would certainly follow the human pattern of how we deal

715
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,735
To give an analogy space shuttles

716
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,783
Things that go into space spacecraft

717
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
They have to be

718
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,135
Good if they're not good people die they have

719
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
No no margin for error at all

720
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
As a result we over-engineering those systems

721
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,095
Most spacecraft have three computers and they all have to agree in unison

722
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
Turn on a particular step to go forward

723
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
One does not agree

724
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,519
Then they recalculate the recalculate the recalculate until they arrive at something

725
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Did the good thing is that hallucinations

726
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,639
Are generally not a systemic problem in terms of its knowledge

727
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
It's often a one-off

728
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,991
What's the model of something tripped it up and it just produced

729
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,319
Working in unison

730
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,671
That will generally speaking improve your

731
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:27,871
Sure I'm going to give you what might be an unsatisfying answer which is it tends to work

732
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:33,759
But I think we know why it tends to work and again it's because these language models approximate how we talk to each other

733
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:38,623
So if I were to say to you hey help me out I need you to mock interview me

734
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,951
That's a direct statement I can make that kicks you into a certain mode of interaction

735
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
Or if I say to you help me out

736
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,559
I'm trying to apologize to my wife

737
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,863
She's really mad at me can you role play with me

738
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,263
Play that kicks you into another motive interaction and and so it's really just a shorthand that people have found to kick the

739
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,079
Agent in to kick the llm into a certain mode of interaction

740
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
The tends to work in the way that I as a software developer

741
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
I'm hoping it would work

742
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:11,135
Being in the digital Humanities that I am I like to think of it as a narrative a narrative will

743
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,183
A few different characters talking to each other

744
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,975
The rules are clearly defined

745
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Two people are not the same

746
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,631
This interaction with GPT it assumes a personality it can simulate personalities

747
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,703
Is it itself is not cautious in any way but it can certainly

748
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:31,103
Predict what a conscious being would react like in a particular situation so when we're going you are

749
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
It is

750
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,711
Drawing of that personality and talking as long as that person

751
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,551
Because it is it is like completing a transcript or completing a story

752
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,087
In which that character is present

753
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
And interacting

754
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,255
I think we got about 5 minutes until the pizza outside

755
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,255
So GPT for One gpc4 release back in

756
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
March I think it was

757
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
It was passing Elsa

758
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,287
That's one of the weird things is that

759
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,407
If you pay for Chachi PT they give you access to the better model

760
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,527
What are the interesting things with it is prompting it's so finicky

761
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,343
It's very sensitive to the way that you prompt

762
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,999
The earlier on when gpt-3 came out some people were going look I can pass literacy tests or no it can't pass

763
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
Call Teresita

764
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,839
And the people who are pro or anti GPT would be like

765
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,911
I modified The Prompt a little bit suddenly I can suddenly I can't

766
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
These things are not conscious

767
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,519
The ability to reason is like an alien

768
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
They're not us they don't think like people they're not human

769
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,895
But they certainly are capable

770
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,479
Of passing some things empirically which demonstrates some sort of

771
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
Rational or logic within the model

772
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
But we're still slowly figuring out

773
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
What exactly the right approach

774
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Companies on top of us who that's their primary product

775
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:33,119
The the value that it adds is like any company I mean it's you know what is the Y combinator

776
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,911
Is there a motto make something people want I mean

777
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,751
I wouldn't think of this as GPT inherently provides value

778
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:44,383
GPT for prioritized access

779
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,687
Where your product might be

780
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,991
Is how you take that and combined it

781
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,831
Your data somebody else's data some domain knowledge some interface

782
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,647
That then helps apply it to something

783
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:59,999
It is two things are both true there are a lot of experiments going on right now

784
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:04,863
Both for fun and people trying to figure out where the economic value is

785
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,959
Companies that are 100% supported by applying this

786
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,903
I I think that it is likely

787
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,255
That today we call this GPT and today we call these flms and tomorrow it will just

788
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:38,655
Slide into The Ether imagine what the imagine what the progression is going to be today there's one of these that the people are primarily

789
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,983
Top

790
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
Tomorrow we can expect

791
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,567
That there will be many of them

792
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,919
And the day after that we can expect they're going to be on our phones and they're not even going to be connected to the internet

793
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,831
And for that reason I think that like today we don't call our software microprocessor tools or

794
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,647
Is microprocessor apps like the processor just exists

795
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,487
I think that one useful Model 5 years

796
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
10 years out

797
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,095
Is to even if it's only metaphorically true and not literally true

798
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:14,495
I think it's useful to think of this as a second processor we have this before with with with floating point

799
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
What processors in graphic scope processors

800
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,503
It's useful to think of the trajectory of this as just another thing that computers to do can do and will be incorporated

801
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,783
Put it into absolutely everything

802
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
Hence the term Foundation model which

803
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:03,391
It's hard to get it to do that reliably it's incredibly useful to get it to do reliable so some tricks you can use

804
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
You can give examples

805
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,231
You can just ask it directly

806
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,791
Those are two common tricks

807
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:16,191
And and look at the prompts that others have used to work I mean there's a lot of art to finding the right prompt right now

808
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
A lot of it is Magic incantation

809
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,567
Another thing you can do is post-process it

810
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,223
So that you can do some checking and you can have a happy path in which it's a one shot and you get your answer and then a sad path

811
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,831
Can which maybe you fall back on other prompts so then you're going for the diversity of approach where

812
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,367
It's it's fast by default

813
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,719
It's slow but ultimately converging upon higher likelihood of success if it fails

814
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:45,119
Instruction tuning style models

815
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,191
Which are more likely to respond with the computer possible

816
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:17,631
That's a great question so the question was and I apologize I just realized we haven't been repeating all the questions for the the YouTube listeners so I'm sorry for the focus on

817
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
Open YouTube if you weren't able to hear some of the questions

818
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:26,079
The question was what are the Privacy implications of some of these prompts if one of the messages is so much depends upon your prompt

819
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,383
In the fine tuning of this prompt what does that mean

820
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,199
With respect to my IP maybe the prompt is my business

821
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:37,599
I can't offer you the exact answer but I can paint for you what approximately the landscape looks like so

822
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,159
In all of software and so too with AI

823
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:46,559
What we see is there the SAS companies where you're using somebody else's API and you're trusting that their terms and service

824
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
This will be upheld

825
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:53,727
There's the set of companies in which they provide a model for hosting on one of the big cloud providers

826
00:51:53,983 --> 00:52:00,127
And this is a version of the same thing but I think with slightly different mechanics this tends to be thought of as the Enterprise version of software

827
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,527
And by and large the industry has moved over the past 20 years from running my own servers to trusting that Microsoft or Amazon or Google can

828
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,623
Run servers for me and they say it's my private server even though I know they're running it

829
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
And I'm okay with that

830
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:18,303
With their own version of

831
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,375
How hard are going to do these where you'll have the SAS version

832
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:30,079
And then there's a third version that I think we haven't yet seen practically emerged but this would be the the maximalist I want to make sure my

833
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:35,967
IP is maximally safe version of events in which you are running your own machines you are running your own models

834
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,503
And then the question is

835
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,831
Is the open source and or privately available version of the model

836
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,415
As good as the publicly hosted one and does that matter to me

837
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,487
And the answer is right now realistically it probably matters a lot

838
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:54,143
In the fullness of time you can think of any one particular task you need to achieve is requiring some fixed point of

839
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
Intelligence to achieve

840
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:01,055
The privately obtainable versions of these models will cross that threshold

841
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,103
And with respect to that one task

842
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,175
Ask ya sure use the open source version run it on your own machine

843
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,735
But will also see the SAS intelligence

844
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
Get smarter it'll probably stay ahead

845
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,087
And then your question is well which one do I care more about

846
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,743
Do I want like the better aggregate intelligence or is my task somewhat fixed point and I can just use the open source available

847
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,559
Cross the threshold

848
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
So to answer your question specifically

849
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
Yes

850
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,287
You might be glad to know if Chachi PT recently updated their privacy policy to not use prompts for the training process

851
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,615
Put up until now everything went back into the bin to be trained

852
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
And that's just

853
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,479
So I think Pizza
